      "question": "Explain the difference between a compiled and interpreted language.",
      "answer": "A compiled language translates the entire source code into a standalone machine code program before execution, resulting in faster performance. An interpreted language, by contrast, translates and executes the code line-by-line in real-time using an interpreter, which offers more flexibility and easier debugging but generally runs slower.",
