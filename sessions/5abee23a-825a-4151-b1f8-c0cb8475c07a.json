      "question": "What are the key features of Python that make it suitable for production?",
      "answer": "Core Production Features\nExtensive Libraries & Frameworks: Python's \"batteries-included\" approach provides pre-built modules for almost any task, from web development (Django, FastAPI) to data science (Pandas, NumPy).\nHigh Maintainability: The simple, readable syntax mirrors natural language, which is critical for large teams managing complex, long-term projects.\nScalability & Architecture Support: While often discussed for its simplicity, Python supports advanced architectures like microservices and integrates seamlessly with containerization tools like Docker and Kubernetes for horizontal scaling.\nInteroperability (Extensibility): Python can easily call modules written in C or C++, allowing developers to optimize performance-critical parts of a production system without rewriting the entire codebase.",

      "question": "Explain the difference between a compiled and interpreted language.",

      "question": "What is a REST API and how does it work?",
      "answer": "A REST API (Representational State Transfer) is a set of rules that allows two computers to communicate over the internet. It is the industry standard for connecting a frontend (like a mobile app or website) to a backend (a server or database)",

      "answer": "Debugging a performance issue requires a systematic, data-driven approach rather than guessing. The goal is to move from broad user-level symptoms to specific technical bottlenecks.",
